Recognised for its world-class service, AirAsia airline has been named Skytrax World’s Best Low-Cost Airline 11 years in a row from 2009 to 2019. AirAsia Group operates scheduled domestic and international flights to more than 165 destinations spanning 25 countries. It has more than 24000 employees working from various locations across the globe. AirAsia wanted a solution that could automate and streamline their employee query resolution process. With this thought in mind, they sought a partner who had deep expertise in this domain.“We were managing employee queries through multiple channels. And hence, it took longer to resolve all the staff queries. We had to create multiple management reports because we were using multiple channels. It was really difficult to monitor.”, says Siew Siew, Head of People Connections.'
